      <p>
        Hello and welcome! My name is Daniel Moore and I am (very proudly to say) a junior web developer. I recently completed a 10-week, immersive Ruby on Rails bootcamp at <a href="www.launchacademy.com">LaunchAcademy</a> in hopes of changing my life and doing something I love. I can't say it was easy, but it definitely was the most rewarding experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been trained mostly in back end development, but my desire to build beautiful interfaces and bring life to data visualization attracts me to front end development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from that, I am a dog lover, a husband, soccer finatic, and someone that's just looking for adventures!

    <p>Dogstay is an easy-to-use web application connecting dog owners with dog sitters. It was built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL for the back end, and Foundation's framework with custom Sass for the front end.</p>
    <p>This app utilizes the Google Maps API and a Geocoder gem, some JavaScript and Ajax functionality, and an intuitive user-experience -- just search, click and connect. (Note: search 'Boston' for sample content)</p>
